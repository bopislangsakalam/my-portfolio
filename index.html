    <h2>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</h2>

    <p>Hello! I’m Devon Angelo M. Ceynas, born and raised in the Philippines. My curiosity about technology started at a young age I was always fascinated by how computers work and how they can be used to solve everyday problems. This early interest grew into a passion that shaped my dream of becoming an IT professional.</p>

    <p>As a student, I enjoy learning about programming, web development, and the latest innovations in technology. I’m constantly exploring new tools and concepts that help me grow both academically and personally. School has taught me the value of hard work, collaboration, and continuous learning — traits that are essential in the tech field.</p>

    <p>My dream is to become a skilled software developer who can create applications that make people’s lives easier. I want to build projects that are not only functional but also meaningful and user-friendly.</p>

    <p>Outside of school, I like spending time exploring creative hobbies like designing, playing games, and watching tech-related content. I also value time with family and friends, which keeps me grounded and motivated.</p>

    <p>My goal is to keep improving my skills and eventually contribute to the growing field of technology. I want to use what I learn to make a positive impact creating solutions that connect people and improve the way we live.</p>
