        <h1>Devon Angelo M. Ceynas</h1>
        <h2>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Devon Angelo M. Ceynas, born and raised in the Philippines. My curiosity about technology started at a young age — I was always fascinated by how computers work and how they can be used to solve everyday problems. This early interest grew into a passion that shaped my dream of becoming an IT professional.</p>

        <p>As a student, I enjoy learning about programming, web development, and the latest innovations in technology. I’m constantly exploring new tools and concepts that help me grow both academically and personally. School has taught me the value of hard work, collaboration, and continuous learning — traits that are essential in the tech field.</p>
